    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> First, we have paneer. Paneer is ubiquitous in Indian cooking and is a great vegetarian alternative to chicken, lamb and other meats. It is a firm, non-melting cheese that is similar in consistency to tofu. Tikka refers to a piece of food that has been marinated and grilled. In this case, the paneer cubes are first marinated
    and later grilled before adding to the gravy. Finally, we have masala. While masala means any number of spices that are mixed, in this case the masala is referring to the spice laden gravy.
    </p>
  <p>  There you have it! Paneer Tikka Masala can literally be translated to a marinated grilled paneer in a creamy, spiced
    gravy! </p>
